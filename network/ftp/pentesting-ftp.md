# Pentesting FTP


# üëâ¬†Overview

---

### üëÄ¬†What ?

> Pentesting FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a process of testing the security of an FTP server. This protocol is used for the transfer of files between a client and a server on a computer network. Pentesting FTP involves identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, in order to improve the security of the server.
> 

### üßê¬†Why ?

> Pentesting FTP is important because FTP servers often contain sensitive information. If an FTP server is not secure, this information could be accessed by unauthorized individuals. Additionally, FTP is an older protocol that does not have built-in encryption, making it more vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct regular pentests to identify and address any potential security issues.

### ‚õèÔ∏è¬†How ?

> Pentesting FTP involves several steps. First, the tester needs to gather information about the FTP server, such as the version of the FTP software and the operating system of the server. This can be done using various tools, such as Nmap. The tester then uses this information to identify potential vulnerabilities. Next, the tester attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities, for example by attempting to log in with default or easily guessable credentials, or by trying to upload or download files without the necessary permissions. Finally, the tester documents their findings and suggests improvements to the server's security.

### ‚è≥¬†When ?

> Pentesting FTP should be conducted regularly, as new vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered. It is particularly important to conduct a pentest whenever changes are made to the FTP server, such as when new software is installed or when the server's configuration is altered.

# ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Technical Explanations

FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for transferring files between a client and a server on a network. FTP operates using two separate connections: a control connection for command transmission, and a data connection for file transfers. However, FTP does not provide encryption, which means all data, including passwords, are transmitted in plain text. This lack of encryption makes FTP servers susceptible to various types of attacks like packet sniffing and brute force attacks.

Pentesting FTP is the process of testing the security of an FTP server to identify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited. The initial step in pentesting FTP involves gathering information about the server, including the server's operating system and the version of the FTP software used. This can be done using tools such as Nmap.

Once the information is collected, the tester identifies potential vulnerabilities and tries to exploit them. This might involve attempting to log in with default or easily guessable credentials, or trying to upload or download files without the necessary permissions. Tools like Wireshark can be used to gather information about the server, while tools like Metasploit can be used to exploit identified vulnerabilities.

The main objective of pentesting is not to inflict damage but to uncover weaknesses. By identifying these vulnerabilities, they can be addressed and rectified before malicious actors have a chance to exploit them. It is vital to conduct pentesting regularly, particularly when changes are made to the server, such as new software installations or changes in server configurations, as new vulnerabilities can emerge.

Here's a detailed educational example of pentesting an FTP server using Nmap and Metasploit:

1. **Information Gathering**: The first step in pentesting an FTP server is to gather information about the server. This could include the server's IP address, the operating system it's running, and the version of the FTP software it's using. For example, the following Nmap command will perform a scan to gather this information:

```bash
nmap -v -A [target IP address]

```

This command performs an aggressive scan (-A) with verbose output (-v) against the target IP address. The output will include information about the FTP server.

1. **Identifying Vulnerabilities**: Once you have gathered information about the server, you can begin to identify potential vulnerabilities. For example, if the server is running an outdated version of the FTP software, it may be vulnerable to known exploits.
2. **Exploitation**: After identifying potential vulnerabilities, you can attempt to exploit them. For instance, if the FTP server is running a version of vsFTPd that is known to be vulnerable to a backdoor command execution exploit, you can use Metasploit to exploit this vulnerability. The following commands will set up and execute this exploit:

```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOST [target IP address]
exploit

```

These commands open the Metasploit console (msfconsole), select the vsFTPd 2.3.4 backdoor command execution exploit (use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor), set the target IP address (set RHOST [target IP address]), and then run the exploit (exploit).

1. **Documentation**: After successfully exploiting the vulnerability, document your findings. This should include the vulnerabilities you discovered, the exploits you used, and any other relevant information.
2. **Remediation**: Once the testing process is complete, the findings can be used to improve the security of the FTP server. This could involve updating the FTP software to a version that isn't vulnerable to the exploit you used, changing default or easily guessable credentials, and implementing other security measures as necessary.

Remember, pentesting should only be conducted on networks and systems where you have explicit permission to do so. Unauthorized testing can be illegal and unethical.
